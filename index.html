  Fired when the data and all additional editor components are ready. Note: This
  event is most useful for plugin developers. When integrating the editor with
  your website or application, you do not have to listen to editor#ready because
  when the promise returned by the static Editor.create() event is resolved, the
  editor is already ready. In fact, since the first moment when the editor
  instance is available to you is inside then()'s callback, you cannot even add
  a listener to the editor#ready event.
